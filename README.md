I successfully developed a full-fledged login system as part of my ongoing Flask project. Building on the knowledge I've gained over the past few weeks in Flask and Snowflake, I implemented a web application with the following key features:

Login System: A secure login page allowing role-based access for users and admins.

Separate Dashboards:

User Dashboard: Displays personal details such as name, DOB, gender, email, phone number, etc.

Admin Dashboard: Allows the admin to perform full CRUD operations, including adding new users and admins, editing user data, and managing the overall system.

Technology Stack:

Frontend: HTML and CSS for the webpage design and structure.

Backend: Flask for server-side logic and routing.

Database: Snowflake used to store and manage user/admin data efficiently.

This implementation demonstrates my growing understanding of web application development and integration of cloud-based databases like Snowflake. I ensured clear separation of roles, secure data handling, and a responsive interface.
